# Designer disrupted, chapter 3

****

**Then
it happened.**

I left Munich feeling pretty good about my chances of
finding work in Germany, what the market would bare in terms of salary
expectations and some next steps for making it all happen. 

I spent the next week, building a new portfolio, tailoring
my Lebenslauf with her feedback and preparing myself for the flood of
interviews that I hoped would be soon filling my calendar. 

But it was November. Germany (particularly southern
Germany) basically shuts down for the last 40 days of the year --- not unlike the
US, but to a greater extent. 

A few open positions trickled in which she put me forward
for consideration for, and a couple of them sighted my language skills for not
taking my application further.

Then, in the latter part of the month, I got an email from
a Creative Director in Bamberg. I had previously applied for a position at his
company, but wasn't selected for an unannounced reason (I may have been too
expensive). 

My contact told me about a former colleague who was
looking for a senior designer with a diverse background a startup in Bamberg.
He put my name on top of the list of potential candidates and sent my contact
information to the CEO. 

"Holy crap, this networking crap really
works!"
