**Out of left field**.

I left Munich feeling pretty good about my chances of finding work in Germany, what the market would bare in terms of salary expectations and some next steps for making it all happen. 

I spent the next week, building a new portfolio, tailoring my Lebenslauf with her feedback and preparing myself for the flood of interviews that I hoped would be soon filling my calendar. 

But it was November. Germany (particularly southern Germany) basically shuts down for the last 40 days of the year --- not unlike the US, but to a greater extent. 

A few open positions trickled in which she put me forward for consideration for, and a couple of them sighted my language skills for not taking my application further.

Then, in the latter part of the month, I got an email from a Creative Director in Bamberg. I had previously applied for a position at his company, but wasn't selected for an unannounced reason (I may have been too expensive). 

My contact told me about a former colleague who was looking for a senior designer with a diverse background a startup in Bamberg. He put my name on top of the list of potential candidates and sent my contact information to the CEO.

**The meeting.**

I was excited, I was elated. I was totally petrified that my German skills would pull the rug out from under me. After a few deep breaths into a paper bag, I put together my portfolio, a formal introduction letter and my Lebenslauf and emailed it to the CEO in preparation of my meeting. 

I woke up early the next day and put all the things I'd need in my backpack, along with printed versions of the Lebenslauf and letter. I cleaned off my Mac's desktop and pre-opened those documents, in case I needed to reference them.

Fast-forward two hours later. I stepped out of the historical building that housed the business' office and felt at least a foot taller. The meeting went very well --- the company's official language was English and the CEO had spent time in the US studying and had previously worked for Apple Computer Germany.

**Actually, I started two days later. **

This is where I work. At a startup, in Germany. In a building and area that was built up before the US was a country. If I could be jealous of myself, I think I might be.

So, what's the lesson here? What did I walk away with from the experience? More soon.
