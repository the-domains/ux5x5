# Designer disrupted, chapter 1

Every few years, the CDC announces a new super-bug. A disease resistant to treatments usually prescribed for illnesses of that ilk. During the announcement, they invariably suggest that citizens be on the look out for 'flu-like symptoms'. Given the vague nature of the symptoms description, almost any illness might trigger alarm bells in the head of anyone not feeling well. 

**Untreated culture shock.**

I was warned about culture shock. But until you're actually in the throws of it, it's an abstract concept that's difficult to wrap one's head around. Culture shock is like a CDC superbug announcement for those visiting and living abroad --- it's something to be on alert for, but anything out of the ordinary could be symptomatic of the condition.

The worst day of culture shock I experienced came early into the move. The shiny finish of our new adventure had worn off, and daily life had begun settling into being. I began the process of filling out paperwork, signing up for German classes and hunting for a job. While that sounds like a very ordered list, the actual experience was an over-lapping chaos.

**Doing it again. And again.**

German expectations of job applicants are different that those in the US. The pre-arrival research I had conducted from California was incomplete, outdated or irrelevant. I had to start from scratch. 

A Lebenslauf is the German resume. It has your photo on it. And your birthday and city of birth. Along with the other things you might expect to find in a resume, except everything is TO THE POINT. Embellishments and nuanced language isn't appreciated and actually frowned upon. So transposing my resume into a German format wasn't really an option. I also had to reformat my portfolio. If you're a fellow designer, you know what a painstaking process this is and the work that goes into it. I ended up creating several versions of my Lebenslauf and several different portfolios, each a slow refinement from the previous version. 

My portfolio went from a broad demonstration of work and capabilities, to several in-depth case studies, each of which built on the over-all picture of my skills and experience. 

After several weeks of looking hit and miss on different German job sites, I contacted a recruiter in Munich I'd found months previously in California and book-marked for this occasion.
