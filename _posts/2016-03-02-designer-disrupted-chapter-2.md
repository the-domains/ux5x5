# Designer disrupted, chapter 2

**The hunter.**

I reached out to the recruiter's office, a branch of Designer Dock, and made an appointment to get to know one another, talk about my work and experience and see if I meshed with any of her clients' needs. 

I took the train down from Bamberg in the morning and decided to go a little early, locate her office and have a coffee and a snack before our meeting. 

The area was a little rough around the edges, but the cafes near by were pretty decent. I soon found one that looked pleasant enough and decided to make it my home-base for the day. 

Navigating the simple task of ordering coffee was something I had been slowly perfecting, but as in most conversational situations, people don't always ask what you expect them to. So after asking for a cappuccino and the soup of the day, the waiter proceeded to ask me a question about something else. 
> 
> Definitely a culture shock moment; when your brain thinks it _might_ know what was just asked of you, offers up a possible response, but doesn't have the words to formulate something intelligible. 

The blank stare of doom offered up to your conversational partner usually results in them repeating what they said in English or in rare cases, of them making a decision of what would be in your best interest, in their opinion.

I had the soup. It was pumpkin. And no, I didn't want the side salad with it.

**The meeting was.**

The recruiter's offices were located at the back of a Hoff, a courtyard within a building, usually surrounded on all sides by the building itself or neighboring buildings --- the likely offspring of a cul-de-sac and an alley way.

Her offices were sparsely appointed in one of those, "furniture is so overrated, appreciate the space" kind of motifs. After a brief introduction we decided English would be better than having me struggle through the conversation in German. 

She liked my work and gave me some great feedback on refining my portfolio for the German market. We talked about what I was looking for, what she had to offer and the kinds of offers or companies I'd like to work for. She also suggested that I would attract a better salary with better German skills (I think my only minus point, but a bit one). She was quite optimistic about my background and capabilities.

**Then that happened.**

I left Munich feeling pretty good about my chances of finding work in Germany, what the market would bare in terms of salary expectations and some next steps for making it all happen. 

I spent the next week, building a new portfolio, tailoring my Lebenslauf with her feedback and preparing myself for the flood of interviews that I hoped would be soon filling my calendar. 

But it was November. Germany (particularly southern Germany) basically shuts down for the last 40 days of the year --- not unlike the US, but to a greater extent. 

A few open positions trickled in which she put me forward for consideration for, and a couple of them sighted my language skills for not taking my application further.

Then, in the latter part of the month, I got an email from a Creative Director in Bamberg. I had previously applied for a position at his company, but wasn't selected for an unannounced reason (I may have been too expensive). 

My contact told me about a former colleague who was looking for a senior designer with a diverse background a startup in Bamberg. He put my name on top of the list of potential candidates and sent my contact information to the CEO.

> "Holy crap, this networking crap really works!"

The CEO called me the same day and we chatted briefly and set up an appointment for the following day. 

**The meeting.**

I was excited, I was elated. I was totally petrified that my German skills would pull the rug out from under me. After a few deep breaths into a paper bag, I put together my portfolio, a formal introduction letter and my Lebenslauf and emailed it to the CEO in preparation of my meeting. 

I woke up early the next day and put all the things I'd need in my backpack, along with printed versions of the Lebenslauf and letter. I cleaned off my Mac's desktop and pre-opened those documents, in case I needed to reference them.

Fast-forward two hours later. I stepped out of the historical building that housed the business' office and felt at least a foot taller. The meeting went very well --- the company's official language was English and the CEO had spent time in the US studying and had previously worked for Apple Computer Germany. 

When can you start?   
How about December first?  
How about tomorrow?

Actually, I started two days later. 

This is where I work. At a startup, in Germany. In a building and area that was built up before the US was a country. If I could be jealous of myself, I think I might be.

So, what's the lesson here? What did I walk away with from the experience?
