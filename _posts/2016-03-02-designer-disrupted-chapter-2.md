**The Hunter.**

I reached out to the recruiter's office, a branch of Designer Dock, and made an appointment to get to know one another, talk about my work and experience and see if I meshed with any of her clients' needs. 

I took the train down from Bamberg in the morning and decided to go a little early, locate her office and have a coffee and a snack before our meeting. 

The area was a little rough around the edges, but the cafes near by were pretty decent. I soon found one that looked pleasant enough and decided to make it my home-base for the day. 

Navigating the simple task of ordering coffee was something I had been slowly perfecting, but as in most conversational situations, people don't always ask what you expect them to. So after asking for a cappuccino and the soup of the day, the waiter proceeded to ask me a question about something else.

> Definitely a culture shock moment; when your brain thinks it _might_ know what was just asked of you, offers up a possible response, but doesn't have the words to formulate something intelligible. 

The blank stare of doom offered up to your conversational partner usually results in them repeating what they said in English or in rare cases, of them making a decision of what would be in your best interest, in their opinion.

I had the soup. It was pumpkin. And no, I didn't want the side salad with it.

**The meeting was.**

The recruiter's offices were located at the back of a Hoff, a courtyard within a building, usually surrounded on all sides by the building itself or neighboring buildings --- the likely offspring of a cul-de-sac and an alley way.

Her offices were sparsely appointed in one of those, "furniture is so overrated, appreciate the space" kind of motifs. After a brief introduction we decided English would be better than having me struggle through the conversation in German. 

She liked my work and gave me some great feedback on refining my portfolio for the German market. We talked about what I was looking for, what she had to offer and the kinds of offers or companies I'd like to work for. She also suggested that I would attract a better salary with better German skills (I think my only minus point, but a bit one). She was quite optimistic about my background and capabilities.
